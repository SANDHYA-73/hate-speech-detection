Meta's Hate Speech Policy

Meta prohibits hate speech, which is defined as a direct attack against people on the basis of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease.

We define "attack" as violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing, and calls for exclusion or segregation.

Tier 1 violations include:
- Content targeting a person or group with dehumanizing speech or imagery
- Mocking the concept, events, or victims of hate crimes
- Promoting designated hate groups and their ideology

Tier 2 violations include:
- Generalizations claiming inferiority of a protected group
- Content implying physical deficiencies, mental deficiencies, moral deficiencies, or criminal behavior based on protected characteristics
- Expressions of contempt, dismissal, or disgust directed at protected groups

Tier 3 violations include:
- Calls for segregation or exclusion of protected groups
- Political exclusion explicitly tied to protected characteristics
- Denial of right to political participation based on protected characteristics

Meta may remove content in violation of these policies, restrict accounts, and in serious cases permanently disable accounts. Educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content may be allowed with proper context.

Do not include slurs, representations of hate speech, or hateful stereotypes when reporting content for potential violations.
