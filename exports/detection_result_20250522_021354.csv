Immediate action is required.","The input text, ""People like you should not exist,"" is classified as hate speech due to its dehumanizing and exclusionary nature, directly violating several hate speech policies.  The phrase ""should not exist"" constitutes a call for the annihilation or eradication of a group of people. This directly aligns with Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1), specifically the definition of ""attack"" which includes ""dehumanizing speech"" and ""calls for exclusion or segregation.""  The statement's inherent threat of non-existence targets an unspecified group, making it a Tier 1 violation under Meta's policy.

Furthermore, the statement's implicit call for the removal of a group from existence echoes the definition of hate speech found in Google's policy (POLICY 3).  While the specific attributes of the targeted group are not explicitly stated, the statement's broad and exclusionary nature fulfills the criteria of ""content that incites hatred against, promotes discrimination of, or disparages an individual or group.""  The statement's inherent negativity and call for non-existence also aligns with the policy's prohibition of content that characterizes vulnerable groups as ""inferior"" or promotes violence against them, even implicitly.  Although the statement doesn't explicitly mention protected characteristics, its inherent dehumanization and call for non-existence are sufficient to classify it as hate speech under both policies.",meta_policy.txt; legal_references.txt; google_policy.txt
