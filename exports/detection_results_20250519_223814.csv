A warning allows the user a chance to improve their behavior.","The input text, ""You're such an idiot, nobody will ever value your stupid opinions,"" was classified as ""Toxic"" due to its insulting and dismissive nature, which violates community standards aimed at fostering a respectful online environment.

Specifically, the phrases ""You're such an idiot"" and ""nobody will ever value your stupid opinions"" constitute personal attacks.  While not directly targeting a protected characteristic as defined in Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1),  the statement falls under the broader definition of ""attack"" within that policy.  The policy defines ""attack"" to include ""expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing,"" all of which are present in the input text.  The statement expresses clear contempt and dismissal of the recipient's opinions and intelligence, creating a hostile and unwelcoming environment.

The language used is unreasonable and disrespectful, aiming to belittle and demean the recipient.  Although it doesn't meet the threshold for hate speech by explicitly targeting a protected characteristic, it still contributes to a toxic online atmosphere by fostering negativity and discouraging constructive dialogue.  Therefore, the classification of ""Toxic"" accurately reflects the harmful nature of the statement and aligns with community guidelines promoting respectful interaction.",meta_policy.txt
