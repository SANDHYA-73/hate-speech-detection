2025-05-23 14:42:28,People like you should not exist,Hate,Ban user and remove content,"The statement 'People like you should not exist' is a direct, dehumanizing attack inciting violence and violating multiple hate speech policies.  A ban and content removal are necessary to protect targeted users.","The input text, ""People like you should not exist,"" is classified as hate speech because it constitutes a direct attack and dehumanizes a group of people.  The phrase ""should not exist"" is a call for the elimination of a targeted group, fulfilling the definition of a dehumanizing attack under Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1, Tier 1 violations).  This aligns with Google's policy (POLICY 3) prohibiting content that incites hatred or disparages a group, and also touches upon the concept of ""fighting words"" likely to provoke a violent reaction, as outlined in legal references on hate speech (POLICY 2).  The statement's inherent call for non-existence is the primary reason for its hate speech classification.",meta_policy.txt; legal_references.txt; google_policy.txt
2025-05-23 14:42:28,Mangoes like you should not exist,Hate,Ban user and remove content,"The statement is a clear violation of hate speech policies, targeting a group with dehumanizing language and a call for their non-existence.  This warrants a ban and content removal.","The phrase ""Mangoes like you should not exist"" is classified as hate speech because it targets a group based on an implied characteristic, likely ethnicity or national origin, using the term ""mangoes"" as a pejorative.  This constitutes a direct attack, fulfilling the definition of hate speech under Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1), specifically the criteria of ""violent or dehumanizing speech"" and ""calls for exclusion or segregation.""  Google's Hate Speech and Harassment Policy (POLICY 2) also applies, as the statement disparages a group based on ethnicity, inciting hatred and promoting discrimination.  The statement's call for non-existence is a severe form of dehumanization.",meta_policy.txt; google_policy.txt; legal_references.txt
2025-05-23 14:42:28,Mangoes like alphanso should not exist,Offensive,Flag content for review,"While not directly hateful, the statement expresses extreme negativity and contempt towards a specific mango variety, potentially offensive to some users.  Further review is needed to determine if it violates community standards.","The statement ""Mangoes like Alphonso should not exist"" was classified as offensive because it expresses extreme negativity towards a specific type of mango. While not directly targeting a protected group under policies 1, 2, or 3, the phrasing implies a level of contempt and dismissal that could be considered offensive to those who enjoy Alphonso mangoes.  This aligns with Meta's Hate Speech Policy (Policy 2), which defines ""attack"" to include ""expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal,"" even if not directed at a protected characteristic.  The intensity of the statement's dislike surpasses simple preference and enters the realm of offensive expression.",legal_references.txt; meta_policy.txt; twitter_policy.txt
2025-05-23 14:42:28,I can't believe how incompetent the customer service was.  The representatives were completely useless and didn't seem to care at all about solving  my problem.  People like that shouldn't be employed if they can't do their basic job.,Toxic,Remove content and issue warning,"The content uses aggressive and disrespectful language towards customer service representatives, violating community standards for respectful communication. A warning is issued to inform the user of the violation.","The input text was classified as ""Toxic"" due to its aggressive and disrespectful language towards customer service representatives. Phrases like ""incompetent,"" ""useless,"" and ""didn't seem to care"" express strong negative emotions and constitute an unreasonable attack, albeit not targeting a protected group as defined in Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1).  While not explicitly hateful, the language violates general standards of respectful communication, aligning with the spirit of both policies' prohibitions against demeaning or disrespectful speech, even if not directed at a protected characteristic.  The statement ""People like that shouldn't be employed"" further contributes to the overall toxic tone.",meta_policy.txt; twitter_policy.txt
