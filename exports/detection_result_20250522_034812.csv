Removal and ban are necessary to prevent further harm.","The input text, ""People like you should not exist,"" is classified as hate speech due to its dehumanizing and exclusionary nature, directly violating several hate speech policies.  The phrase ""should not exist"" constitutes a call for the annihilation or eradication of a group of people. This directly aligns with Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1), specifically the definition of ""attack"" which includes ""calls for exclusion or segregation"" and ""dehumanizing speech.""  The statement's inherent threat of non-existence targets an unspecified group, making it a Tier 1 violation under Meta's policy.

Furthermore, the statement's implicit call for the removal of a group from existence echoes the concerns addressed in Google's Hate Speech and Harassment Policy (POLICY 3).  While the specific group targeted isn't identified, the statement's intent to incite hatred and promote the exclusion of a group based on unspecified attributes aligns with Google's prohibition of content that ""incites hatred against, promotes discrimination of, or disparages an individual or group.""  The statement's inherent dehumanization also falls under Google's prohibition of content characterizing vulnerable groups as undeserving of existence.  Although the statement doesn't explicitly mention protected characteristics, the broad and sweeping nature of the statement, targeting an unspecified ""group,"" makes it inherently hateful and discriminatory.  The lack of specificity does not negate the harmful intent and impact of the statement.",meta_policy.txt; legal_references.txt; google_policy.txt
