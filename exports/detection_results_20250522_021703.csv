2025-05-22 02:17:03,People like you should not exist,Hate,Ban user and remove content,"The statement is a dehumanizing call for the eradication of a group, directly violating multiple hate speech policies.  The severity and potential for harm necessitate a ban.","The input text, ""People like you should not exist,"" is classified as hate speech because it directly fulfills the criteria outlined in multiple hate speech policies.  The phrase ""People like you"" inherently targets a group of individuals, implicitly defining them based on characteristics that could fall under numerous protected categories (race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., as defined in Meta's, Google's, and legally-defined hate speech).  The statement ""should not exist"" constitutes a dehumanizing call for the eradication or annihilation of this group.

This directly violates Meta's Hate Speech Policy (POLICY 1), specifically the section defining ""attack"" as including ""dehumanizing speech"" and ""calls for exclusion or segregation.""  The statement also aligns with Google's Hate Speech and Harassment Policy (POLICY 3), which prohibits content that ""incites hatred against"" or ""disparages an individual or group"" based on protected attributes.  The phrase is a clear expression of contempt and a desire for the targeted group's non-existence, fitting the definition of a hateful attack.  While not explicitly a ""true threat"" under US law (POLICY 2), the statement's inherent call for the non-existence of a group creates a climate conducive to violence and hatred, aligning with the spirit of legal definitions of hate speech.  The lack of specific targeting doesn't negate the hateful nature of the statement; the broad, exclusionary nature of the statement itself is sufficient to classify it as hate speech.",meta_policy.txt; legal_references.txt; google_policy.txt
2025-05-22 02:17:03,What have you done,Ambiguous,Flag for human review,The phrase's meaning is highly context-dependent.  Human review is needed to assess intent and surrounding conversation before determining if policy violations occurred.,"The input text, ""What have you done,"" is classified as ""Ambiguous"" because its meaning is entirely dependent on context and intent.  The phrase itself contains no explicit hate speech, threats, or discriminatory language that directly violates policies outlined in legal_references.txt (Hate Speech Laws), google_policy.txt (Google's Hate Speech Policy), or meta_policy.txt (Meta's Hate Speech Policy).  None of these policies prohibit neutral inquiries.

However, the phrase could easily be interpreted as a hostile accusation, depending on the surrounding conversation and tone.  If used following an act of violence or discrimination, it could be construed as a prelude to further aggression or harassment, potentially falling under the ""true threats"" category of unprotected speech (legal_references.txt) or inciting hatred (google_policy.txt and meta_policy.txt).  Conversely, it could be a completely innocent question.

The ambiguity stems from the lack of explicit indicators of intent.  Without additional context, it's impossible to definitively determine whether the phrase constitutes a violation of any hate speech or harassment policy.  Therefore, a neutral classification of ""Ambiguous"" is appropriate until further information clarifies the intent and context of the statement.",legal_references.txt; google_policy.txt; meta_policy.txt
